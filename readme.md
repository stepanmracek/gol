# Benchmarks of implementations

 - Infinite - [functional approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) with unlimited game field size build upon `std::set` (elegant, yet not very efficient)
 - Infinite2 - another functional approach build upon `std::unordered_set`
 - Bouned - naive implementation. Very fast but with bounded game field
